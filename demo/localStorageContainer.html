    <h1>Voting pagelet data layer Demo</h1>
    <p> The code in this page hooks to `sessionStorage` used by <a href="../src/voting.html">voting.html</a> and routes the data
        from there to `localStorage`, which you could be replaced with another type of data sync like back-end DB via web service.
